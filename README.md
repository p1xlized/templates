# Templates - My Templates
I use these templates to quickly start a project, and devenv files so i could easily apply to existing projects.

### Usage
1. To use it just clone and use it you need to install `nix` and `devenv`
2. run `devenv shell` to start the development shell>
3. the folder `devenv_configs` contains plug-in files that you can use it in other projects, just copy `devemv.nix` and `devenv.yaml` and paste into your project and access it by `devenv shell`.

> [!CAUTION]
> Works only Linux, Mac with `nix-darwin` and `WSL`, if you want to use it on windows you have to run it through `WSL`
